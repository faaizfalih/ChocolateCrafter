Design Guidelines

Design Principles:

Minimalist, premium, image-first

Maximum use of negative space

Rich product photography with clean UI

Use thin lines, lightweight fonts, subtle motion (fade-ins, not zooms)

DOs:

Feature high-res images (top-down, angled, sliced, packaging)

Stick to grid-based layout with elegant margins

Pair neutral tones (white, black, soft cream) with visual pops from ingredients (pink, green)

Use consistent button styling (rounded corners, flat-fill or outlined)

Use the image attached as the reference for the HOMEPAGE ONLY (DO NOT COPY THE CONTENT, ONLY THE DESIGN)

DON’Ts:

No pop-up coupons, no loud banners

No cluttered text blocks or over-promotion

Avoid visual noise – limit fonts and animations
